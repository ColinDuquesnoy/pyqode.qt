   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pyqode.qt's documentation!
=====================================

**pyqode.qt** is a `shim`_ that let you write libraries/applications that
supports both PyQt and PySide.


We provide support for PyQt5, PyQt4 and PySide using the PyQt5 layout (where
the QtGui module has been split into QtGui and QtWidgets).


Basically, you write your code as if you were using PyQt5 but import qt from
``pyqode.qt`` instead of ``PyQt5``.
